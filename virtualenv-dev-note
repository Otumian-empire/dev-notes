Virtual Environment - virtualenv

This is a python module just like pipenv that allows development of app such that the app has its own modules/packages to work without interfering with the system module. So if a module requires update and it is been update on our local/remote system, it does not affect the app.


Installation
pip install virtualenv


Create a virtual environment
Create a directory for you p
ython project and with that directory, do, virtualenv <virtualenv_name>

virtualenv is the module and <virtualenv_name> is the name of the virtual environment we
want to create for our project. So virtualenv venv, creates a virtual environment called , venv.

This will install all the tools to work with.


Activate virtual environment
source <virtualenv_name>/bin/activate.

source venv/bin/activate activates the virtual environment you created earlier.
One of the ways to know that you've activated the virtual environment is that the name of the virtual environment will appear before your computer name. Also which python will show the python path with the project dorectory name in the virtual environment directotory.


Install a package
pip install <package_name>


Install package from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt


Show the installed packages in the virtual environment
pip list
pip freeze --local


Save packages into a requirements.txt file
pip list > requirements.txt


Deactivate virtual environment
deactivate

Delete virtual environment
rm -rf <virtualenv_name>

Make sure you are in the same directory as the virtual environment.
