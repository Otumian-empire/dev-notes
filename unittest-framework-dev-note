UnitTest Framework - test concepts
- test fixture: This represents the preparation needed to perform one or more tests, and any associate cleanup actions. This may involve, for example, creating temporary or proxy databases, directories, or starting a server process.

- test case: This is the smallest unit of testing. This checks for a specific response to a particular set of inputs. unittest provides a base class, TestCase, which may be used to create new test cases.

- test suite: This is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both. This is used to aggregate tests that should be executed together. Test suites are implemented by the TestSuite class.

- test runner: This is a component which orchestrates the execution of tests and provides the outcome to the user. The runner may use a graphical interface, a textual interface, or return a special value to indicate the results of executing the tests.
