The 5S philosophy comprises these concepts
------------------------------------------
1. Seiri, or organization (think “sort” in English).
Knowing where things are — using approaches such as suitable naming—is crucial.

2. Seiton, or tidiness (think “systematize” in English).
There is an old American saying: A place for everything, and everything in its
 place. A piece of code should be where you expect to find it—and, if not, you
  should re-factor to get it there.
  
3. Seiso, or cleaning (think “shine” in English).
Keep the workplace free of hanging wires, grease, scraps, and waste. What do the
 authors here say about littering your code with comments and commented-out code
  lines that capture history or wishes for the future? Get rid of them.

4. Seiketsu, or standardization.
The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean. Do you think this book 
says anything about having a consistent coding style and set of practices 
within the group? Where do those standards come from? Read on.

5. Shutsuke, or discipline (self-discipline).
This means having the discipline to follow the practices and to frequently 
reflect on one’s work and be willing to change.
