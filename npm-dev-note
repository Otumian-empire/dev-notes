npm notes
---------

npm = node package manager

npm provides online repositories for packages for nodejs and devs use
 it locally to manage their dependencies

npm -v : will display the version of npm on your device and that also
 indicates that you have installed npm
 
npm packages can be installed in two ways:
    1. locally: locally installed packages only exist for the
         applications for the application under development.
         npm install <package name>: install package locally
          in application we are developing and such can only be
          accessed by that app alone
    2. globally: globally installed packages can be access anywhere
         npm install -g <package name>: installs package globally
    
Note that anything that can be used on the commandline should be globally
 installed

```
But in general, it is a good practice to install the packages locally.
 This is because you might be having a number of Node.js projects in
 your system having a different version of each of the packages used 
in them. 

Thus, you should make a package global only when it has a CLI 
 executable command and can be reused throughout the projects in your
 system.
``` 

npm install: will resolve and fetch all of the necessary packages for the 
application to run

npm list -g --depth 0: checks how many global packages are installed

npm uninstall <package_name>: uninstalls a package

npm install <package_name> --save: adds package to package.json

npm install <package_name> --no-save: does not add package to package.json

npm install <package_name> --save-dev: adds package to package.json
 as a dev package - ```devDependencies are packages used for 
 development purposes â€” for example, for running tests or transpiling 
 code.```

npm install -g npm@latest: to update npm

npm search <package name>: searched for a package
