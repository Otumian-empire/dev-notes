Design thinking process 
1. Empathize: conduct an interview to find out 
what people really care about. what are the different ways to deal with 
what they are thinking. connect it with a personal story where it became 
difficult. repeat this process with many people. 
2. define the problem: try to understand the needs people are 
trying to fulfill (underline verbs or activities)
3. ideate: focus on the 
problem statement and come up with ideas that solves
 the problem. Sketch up the idea and show them to the people you are 
trying to help so you can get their feed back.
4. prototype:reflect on the 
ideas to how your solution fit in people actual life and build something 
5. test: test the prototype with actual users and remember not to 
necessarily defend your idea in case when people don't like it. the point 
is to learn what works and what didn't then go back to 2 or 3 repeating 
the process.
